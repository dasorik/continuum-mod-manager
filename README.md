Continuum Mod Manager is a game agnostic mod manager and modification engine that allowings users to install/uninstall mods that either they or other users have authored. Built from the ground up to allow for modding support of any game, Continuum's aims is to allow modders to easily share their creations with others.

## 📋 Features
* **Mod With Ease**
  * Easily organize, configure and install mods with ease, all from the one place.
* **Game Integrations**
  * Extensibility is at the core of Continuum. Through community based game integraions, Continuum can be made to support any game.
* **Mod Collision Tracking**
  * Continuum tracks all file modifications made and will attempt to resolve any conflicts that is comes across. Due to the unique way the installation process is handled (which doesn't run mod installation steps in sequence) Continuum can gracfully resolve conflicts where other mod installers would fail.
* **Modificiation Engine** (Continuum.Core)
  * In addition to the graphical mod manager interface, Continuum also features a rich file modiication engine. *Continuum.Core* is a standalone modification library which acts as the backbone for Continuum's mod installation. Continuum.Core can be integrated into any .NET application, allowing for other applications to make use of it's features.
