```

## Disabling Mod Actions
All mod installation actions also have an additional property called `Disabled`. This setting takes a predicate in the format:

`{setting-name} {operator} {value}`:

* Setting Name
  * Must reference one of the settings from either the mod or integration.
  * Mod settings are referenced via `$MOD.{setting-name}` (eg. `$MOD.replace-icon`)
  * Integration settings are referenced via `$INTEGRATION.{setting-name}` (eg. `$MOD.replace-icon`)
  * A third special value can be used in lieu of a mod/integration setting. `$INTEGRATION_ID` can be used to optionally enable/disable installation steps depending on the game integration the mod is being installed for (you can use this to create integration specific installation steps if targeting multiple integrations)
* Operator
  * Any of the normal arithmatic operators are available to use in this query ('=', '<', '>', '<=', '>=', '!=')
* Value
  * This can either be a constant value (ie. text, a number, or a boolean value), or can be a reference to another setting

```json
{
  "Action": "CopyFile",
  "TargetFile": "[Game]\\player_icon.xml",
  "DestinationPath": "[Game]\\player_icon_backup.xml",
  "Disabled": "$MOD.replace-icon = false"
}
```

In the example above, if the setting `replace-icon` is set to `false` the 'CopyFile' action will not be enabled during mod install, and `player_icon_backup.xml` will not be created.
